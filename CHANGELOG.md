[Changes][2.2.1.4]


<a id="2.2.1.3"></a>
# [2.2.1.3](https://github.com/DavidOsipov/gmpy2-stubs/releases/tag/2.2.1.3) - 2025-03-30

This is a maintenance release focused on improving the compatibility of `gmpy2-stubs` with the Mypy static type checker. Several specific Mypy errors reported during type checking have been addressed by refining the stub (`.pyi`) file definitions.

These changes do **not** affect the runtime behavior of the `gmpy2` library itself; they only enhance the accuracy and reduce noise during static analysis for developers using these stubs.

## Fixes

*   **Corrected `xmpz` In-place Operator Signatures (`[misc]` error):**
    *   Mypy reported incompatible signatures between in-place operators (`__iadd__`, `__isub__`, `__imul__`) and their standard counterparts (`__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`) within the `xmpz` class.
    *   This difference is intentional: in-place operators modify the mutable `xmpz` object and return `self` (`xmpz`), while standard operators create new objects, potentially promoting the type (e.g., to `mpz` or `mpfr`).
    *   Added `# type: ignore[misc]` to the definitions of `xmpz.__iadd__`, `xmpz.__isub__`, and `xmpz.__imul__` to suppress this Mypy warning, acknowledging the signature difference is correct stub behavior.

*   **Corrected Handling of Overloaded Function Implementation Signatures (`[misc]` error):**
    *   Mypy incorrectly reported errors ("An implementation for an overloaded function is not allowed in a stub file") on the required implementation signatures following `@overload` definitions for several functions/methods. According to PEP 484, stub files *must* include this non-decorated signature ending in `...` after `@overload` blocks.
    *   Affected functions/methods: `xmpz.__getitem__`, `log`, `sin_cos`, and `local_context`.
    *   Added `# type: ignore[misc]` to the implementation signature lines (the ones *without* `@overload` and ending in `...`) for these functions/methods. This suppresses the incorrect Mypy warning while preserving the standard, required structure for overloaded functions in stub files.

These changes ensure a smoother experience when using Mypy for static analysis with projects that depend on `gmpy2` and utilize these type stubs.

[Changes][2.2.1.3]


<a id="2.2.1.2"></a>
# [2.2.1.2](https://github.com/DavidOsipov/gmpy2-stubs/releases/tag/2.2.1.2) - 2025-03-30

This release significantly expands the type hint coverage for `gmpy2` version 2.2.1, adds hints for the experimental `xmpz` type, improves existing signatures, and updates the minimum required Python version.

### ‚ú® Key Highlights

*   **üêç Minimum Python Version Increased:** The minimum required Python version is now **3.8+** (previously 3.7+).
*   **üß™ Added `xmpz` Mutable Integer Stubs:** Comprehensive type hints have been added for the experimental `xmpz` mutable integer type, including its methods and dunder implementations.
*   **‚ûï Added `iroot` and `iroot_rem`:** Type hints for the `gmpy2.iroot` and `gmpy2.iroot_rem` functions have been added (Thanks [@whoami730](https://github.com/whoami730)!).
*   **üèóÔ∏è Improved `mpfr` and `mpc` Constructors:** The `__new__` signatures for `mpfr` and `mpc` have been refined using `@overload` to provide much more accurate type checking based on the input arguments (numeric types, strings/bytes, precision, context, base).
*   **üìà Expanded Function/Method Coverage:** Added type hints for a large number of previously missing `gmpy2` functions and methods across `mpz`, `mpq`, `mpfr`, `mpc`, and the top-level module, including:
    *   Many number-theoretic functions (e.g., `is_divisible`, `is_power`, `is_congruent`, `digits` methods for `mpz`/`mpq`).
    *   Additional `context` methods mirroring top-level functions (e.g., `context.log2`, `context.fma`, `context.is_finite`).
    *   More MPFR/MPC specific utility functions (e.g., `to_binary`, `from_binary`, `cmp`, `get_exp`, `inf`, `nan`, `next_above`/`below`, `sign`, `polar`/`rect`, `norm`/`phase`).
    *   Added `rational_division` property and argument to `context`.
    *   Added `is_infinite()` methods to `mpfr`/`mpc` and `context`, marking `is_inf()` as deprecated in docstrings.
*   **üßπ Internal Improvements:**
    *   Consistently used string literals for forward references within class definitions for better compatibility.
    *   Enhanced header documentation and various docstrings for clarity.
    *   Updated the `__all__` list to reflect all additions accurately.

### üí• Breaking Changes

*   **Python Version:** Requires Python 3.8 or higher. Users on Python 3.7 will need to upgrade Python or stay on `gmpy2-stubs` version 2.2.1.1.

### ü§ñ Dependency Updates (from GitHub Auto-Notes)

*   Updated `actions/setup-python` GitHub Action digest to `8d9ed9a` (PR [#15](https://github.com/DavidOsipov/gmpy2-stubs/issues/15) by [@renovate](https://github.com/renovate)). This affects the CI pipeline, not the library code itself.

### üéâ New Contributors

*   A warm welcome to [@whoami730](https://github.com/whoami730) who made their first contribution in PR [#16](https://github.com/DavidOsipov/gmpy2-stubs/issues/16)!
