# allowlist.txt for gmpy2-stubs version 2.2.1.5

# --- Runtime Signature Mismatches ---

# The runtime incorrectly reports the signature for __rpow__ as accepting
# a 'mod' argument (def (self, value, mod=None, /)), similar to __pow__.
# However, Python's reverse power mechanism (__rpow__) never uses the
# third 'mod' argument. The stubs correctly omit 'mod' for __rpow__.

gmpy2.xmpz.__rpow__

# --- Undocumented/Internal Symbols ---
# These were previously allowlisted based on errors likely caused by
# stubtest looking inside the internal gmpy2.gmpy2 submodule.
# When comparing against the top-level gmpy2 module, these are not found,
# so they are no longer needed in the allowlist.
